The Spiritualist
==============================

Published in London from 1869-1882, ‘The Spiritualist’ is a key title of the spiritualist movement,
and significant in relation to the development of the movement in the UK. 
Unusually for this era it has a strong focus on women, due to their dominance in the movement.

Edinburgh-born Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was among the supporters of spiritualism.
